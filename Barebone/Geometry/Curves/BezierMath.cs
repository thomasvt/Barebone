        // Bezier curves are not just mathematical functions f(t). They can have multiple points at a single value of t, eg. they can form a looping. Single math functions cannot model that.

        // Instead, Bezier curves are a combination of two math functions fx(s) and fy(s) where each 2D point on the curve is (x,y) = (fx(s), fy(s)) 
        // The function definitions and their parameters (and how to calculate them from all 4 Bezier points) can be found here:
        // https://moshplant.com/direct-or/bezier/math.html 

        // A problem with bezier curves is that they get calculated per s, where s is not one of the axes, but the distance ALONG the CURVE itself. So, if you imagine a bezier curve to be a rope,
        // s is the percentage distance along that rope. The fx(s) and fy(s) functions then return the X and Y position of where the corresponding point on the rope is.

        // Therfore, when we need to find Y values for a given point on X, we can't just use those functions.

        // We need to use 2 steps:
        // 1. use fx(s) to find s at a certain X - this is not straight forward as we want the opposite of what fx(s) does: we need the input s where output x is a known value.
        // 2. use fy(s) to find Y at that s. This is straight forward: y = fy(s)

        // step 1 is the hardest: we use root-finding for that, with Newton-Raphson. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_method
