Manifold is a simple, 2D version of Houdini or Graphene: a procedural generation system for generating 2D graphics using node graphs.

The name "Manifold" refers to the mathematical concept: a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space.

The concept of dealing with very simple geometry when zoomed in on the node-graph while this resulting in complex structures when zoomed out resembles the concept of manifolds.
Many of the primitive nodes in Manifold are manifolds themselves too, such as curves, circles, lines.
